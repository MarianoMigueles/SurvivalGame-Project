## About projects

Zombie Cube Game is a simple game project created with the purpose of improving my understanding and skills in object-oriented programming. The game is straightforward: you play as a character with a gun and must survive endless waves of "zombies." The game has no definitive ending and is designed purely for a few minutes of fun.
